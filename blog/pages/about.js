      <p>So, people have landed on your site. They already saw the homepage where you introduce your blog,
         products, or services. Now they want to find more information about the person or people behind the 
         products or services you offer. This is when they look for your “About Us” page 
         to know more about you! The page can go by different names “About”, “Our story” 
         but their purpose is the same. To tell visitors who you are, and why they should choose your business!</p>
